# Lagrange interpolation and BN254

This project is a Lagrange interpolation algorithm adaptation for use with points on BN254 curve. The primary goal is to test opportunities of ark-poly crate, that doesn't include constructing polynomials based on points.

## Lagrange interpolation

Lagrange interpolation is a mathematical technique that finds a polynomial passing through given points. Formula:
